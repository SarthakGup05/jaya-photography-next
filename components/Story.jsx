                I have had the privilege of working with the most amazing clientele who help me love my work a bit more. My favourite are the adorable toddlers on sets. It's a delight to speak to them in their language, make them pose for the camera, and seeing them smile.

                Whether it's babies or adult fashion models or even expecting mothers, I can not stress enough how important it is to make the subjects comfortable. I won't get a good picture till I make them happy, and I won't stop till I get a good picture.

                Some times when I feel demotivated, I go back to the messages these parents have sent me after the shoot and I swear it's the most beautiful thing.
